I'm rationalizing E as "they can variably change the force on the feathers"
if so, they could actually force inward some, to get some translation motion while in the air
effectively yawing left/right
and if that force is inward, at the wingtip, they have a LOT of muscle to resist that motion, since it's inline with the joints when extended
We could also do some different coloration/animation for the bigger ones, maybe they only do impulses/bursts
they're bigger because they capacitate, but all the feathers can output the same force.
Making the littler ones much stronger.
when the griffon takes off, they could perhaps have their wings folded, and open them once airborne. to get that impulse force behind them from the big feathers
I also LOVE the idea of using these feathers to swing that leading wing-bone into something
